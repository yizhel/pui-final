This is my final project for PUI Spring 2023.

I made a website for the Fencing Club at CMU. This website is meant for current students to find out more information about the club and fencing in general, as well as serve as a public facing site for prospective students who might be interested in fencing at CMU. To achieve these goals, my website features an about page that has information about the club and fencing, an events page with tournaments we have hosted or competed in, and finally a live schedule for current students to attend our practices. This website uses strong contrast for the interactive visuals, as well as an interactive carousel on the main page that draws the userâ€™s attention with action photographs.

This website was built using Bootstrap and JQuery.
